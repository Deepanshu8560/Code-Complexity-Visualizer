# Project Description: Code Complexity Visualizer

- Developed a real-time Code Analyzer visualizing Time/Space complexity with AI-driven optimization and detailed code metrics.
- Engineered using React, FastAPI, and Groq AI (Llama 3.1) to deliver sub-second algorithmic profiling and suggestions.
- Empowered developers with instant complexity feedback, drastically reducing code inefficiencies and accelerating optimization workflows.
